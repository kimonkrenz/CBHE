# Connected Bradford Health and Environment

This repository includes functions and an R Markdown file outlining an address matching procedure to match NHS GP address information to Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium data. The procedure is based on the NHSBSA Data Analytics 'addressMatchR' (https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/addressMatchR) an adapted to run solely in R without the requirement of an Oracle database. Further adaptations were made to tailor the approach to particularities of GP address information.
