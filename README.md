This repository includes an R Markdown file outlining an address matching procedure to match NHS GP address information to Ordnance Survey (OS) AddressBase Premium data. The procedure is based on the NHSBSA Data Analytics 'addressMatchR' (https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/addressMatchR) an adapted to run solely in R without the requirement of an Oracle database.
